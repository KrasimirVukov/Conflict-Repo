Now, in "TestRepo1" folder create another .txt file, give it a name add some text inside and save the file. For
example, we named our file CommitFromGitHubDesktop.txt.
On GitHub Desktop try to commit and push the second file. A pop-up window will appear telling you that there are
new commits on remote and will ask you to fetch, before trying to push. This happens because the repository in
“TestRepo1” folder is older than the repository in GitHub and doesn’t contain the changes we made via GitBash.
