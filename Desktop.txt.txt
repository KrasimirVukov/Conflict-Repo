Now you have two absolutely identical copies of your repository in two different folders on your computer. Imagine
that these are two different people, each working on its own copy, on its own computer.
In “TestRepo” folder create a .txt file, give it a name, and add some text inside and save the file. For example, our file
is called CommitFromGitBash.txt.
On GitBash: Go to the cloned repository directory using: cd path/to/your/repository
Stage the changes using: git add CommitFromGitBash.txt
Commit the changes using: git commit -m "First commit"
Push the changes to GitHub using: git push origin main
On GitHub: Go and check if the file that you just pushed is uploaded.
